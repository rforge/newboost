\title{Function for calculation of different MSEs}
\usage{
MSECal(object, yref = NULL, Xnew = NULL, beta.true = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{object of class \code{L2Boost} or \code{L2BoostOGA}}

\item{yref}{reference variable with regard to which the MSE is calculated (e.g. the observed dependent variables or some oracle)}

\item{Xnew}{design matrix of the observations for which prediction accuracy shall be evaluated.}

\item{beta.true}{the ture beta coefficient if known}
}
\value{
The function returns a list with different measures of the the predictive accuracy.
}
\description{
This function is mainly used for analyzing the performance of the L2Boost and orthogonal L2Boost algorithms.
